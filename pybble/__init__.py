    """The Rubble web services use HTTP Basic authentication for
    everything except for the URL paths /rubble/service/cluster-probe
    and /rubble/webdav/www/, which may be accessed without
    authentication. The cluster-probe service is intended for calls
    from the Azure load balancer to determine server
    responsiveness. The www WebDAV folder is intented for central
    management of various web resources that can be cached by the
    reverse proxy frontend. [This folder is not yet implemented, the
    files are currently duplicated on each frontend instance.]

    The authentication credentials consist of an API key and a
    secret. They function as the username and password in the HTTP
    Basic protocol. Application developers sign up in a separate web
    app where they can generate their own API keys and secrets. There
    are also master credentials used for bootstrapping and for
    intra-cluster communication.  A class to talk to the rubble
    service.

        messages to the pseudo-channel default, the terms in these

        enqueued messages and is delivered in the same transaction as
        the request.

        Arguments
        ---------

        pid=PID

            A numeric process ID that identifies the process.

        prettyprint=PRETTYPRINT

            0 = retrieve the process state exactly as stored in the

        --------

        pid

            For convenience. Same as the query parameter PID. The
            process ID of the newly created process. Note: this is a
            JSON string (of digits), not a JSON number.

        modtime

            Time of last modification. This is a time coordinate,
            approximately the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00
            UTC on January 1, 1970. Note: this is a JSON number, not a
            string.

        domain

            The domain of this process. For a non-privileged
            application this is always the same as the caller's
            authenticated domain.

        rulesref

            See documentation for processcreate.

        factsformat

            See documentation for processcreate.

        facts

            See documentation for processcreate.

        trapstate (optional)

            An optional string containing an XML document that
            represents any exceptional processing state. See below for
            an explanation of this XML document.

        Example of a response body:

            {
              "content":
              {
                "pid":"4711",
                "modtime":1367237523740,
                "domain":"acme",
                "rulesref":"file:/foo.rubble",
                "factsformat":1,
                "facts":"empty(glass); empty(wallet); full(moon);"
              }
            }

        If no process exists with the specified PID, or if the application
        isn't allowed to access it, an error message is returned:

            {
                "error": "No such process or unauthorized access"
            }

        Example of a trapstate property value:

            <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
            <trapstate>
                <timestamp>1368101400107</timestamp>
                <cause>ERROR</cause>
                <description>Inference failure: CONTRADICTION crazy_fact</description>
                <triggering-message>input(pid(42),crazy_fact);</triggering-message>
                <reschedule-delay>60000</reschedule-delay>
                <discard-after>172800000</discard-after>
            </trapstate>

        The above example describes a process rule execution that was aborted
        due to detection of a logical contradiction. No more messages will be
        received by this process instance until the trapstate has been cleared,
        or unless a specified condition holds. Any messages not received by
        this process while the trapstate is non-null will be delayed by the
        number of milliseconds specified by <reschedule-delay>. If
        <discard-after> milliseconds have passed since the time specified by
        <timestamp>, the message will be silently discarded instead.

        The value of the <cause> element determines how execution proceeds.

        Possible values of <cause>

        ERROR

            Set by syntax errors and exceptions during rule execution.

        PAUSED

            Set intentionally when there is a need to pause further processing
            for this process instance, for administrative or debugging reasons.

        PAUSE-ON-CONDITION

            Used for debugging. Execution proceeds normally despite trapstate
            being non-null, but at the end of each process-state transition a
            logical condition is evaluated. If this condition is true, the
            trapstate <cause> is changed to PAUSED, stopping further execution.
            The logical condition is specified by a fragment of Rubble code in
            the element <pause-condition> in the trapstate.

        The element <triggering-message> contains the fact terms of the input
        message that caused the trap. Native Rubble syntax is used for these
        terms. This is for display & debugging only. Any changes made to this
        data are ignored, it's only a copy of the pending message stored in the
        message queue.

        rulesref

            A string that specifies the rule file that contains
            the Rubble code which controls this process. This string should
            have either the format file:/PATH or the format
            file://DOMAIN/PATH. For compatibility with RFC 3986 the variant
            for var in collection:
            mat file:///PATH is accepted as equivalent to the single-slash
            format.

        factsformat (optional)

            Specifies the storage format of the Rubble process state for
            this process. If provided, this property is either one of the
            strings native, xml, json, or the number 1 or 2. The
            alternatives xml or 2 cause the facts to be stored internally
            in XML format and require the facts property to be supplied as
            a string containing the initial XML code. The alternatives
            native or 1 cause the facts to be stored internally in Rubble
            native format and require the facts property to be supplied as
            a string containing the initial Rubble code. The alternative
            json causes the facts to be stored internally in Rubble native
            format and requires the facts property to be supplied as a
            JSON array (see Appendix A, JSON-encoded Rubble facts). The
            default value for factsformat is json.

        facts (optional)

            The initial process state, in the syntax specified by
            factsformat. The default syntax is a JSON array (see Appendix
            A, JSON-encoded Rubble facts). The default value is an empty
            set of facts. An empty string is always legal here, in the XML
            case it will be automatically converted into the empty root
            element <rubble/>.

        trapstate (optional)

            An optional string containing an XML document that represents
            any exceptional processing state. If this string is omitted or
            left blank, normal processing will be assumed. See
            documentation of process for details. This property is

        pid

            The process ID of the process to update. Note: this must
            be a JSON string (of digits), not a JSON number.

        rulesref

            See docstring for processcreate.

        Keyword arguements
        ------------------

        factsformat (optional)

            See documentation for processcreate.

        facts (optional)

            See documentation for processcreate.

        trapstate (optional)

            See documentation for processcreate.

        Note: the optional properties are defaulted in the same
        way as for processcreate, i.e. they are not defaulted to
        their stored values.

        The response is an empty JSON object {} on success, or
        {"error":"Unauthorized access"} if the caller didn't have
        permission.
